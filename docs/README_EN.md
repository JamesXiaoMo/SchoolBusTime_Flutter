## 💡Current version:Version2.2.0

## 📖Introduction
"SchoolBusTime" is an application designed for students at Fukuyama University in Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan, allowing them to check the real-time schedule of school buses. The inspiration came on a sunny Friday afternoon. Even though I was in my artificial intelligence class, my mind was already elsewhere, eager to head home. I opened the Fukuyama University website to check the departure time of the next bus. It was then that I realized how a simple query required several clicks on the website, which clearly violated the principles of user interaction design. Thus, the idea for "SchoolBusTime" was born. Unlike the previous Lite version, this new release is based on Flutter’s cross-platform technology, and it will be available for both iOS and Android.
